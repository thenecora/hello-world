# hello-world

Hello little humans!

I'm Nerea, and I'm just starting in the programming world. Right now, I'm diving into SCSS to learn more about front-end development. However, I'm doing a full stack development course where I'll learn about JavaScript, React and Python, so I hope GitHub can help me with my projects. Can't wait!

Oh, I'm also a bookworm, a big fan of Spanish croquetas and Mexican food and I'm basically deaf. JUST TALK LOUD TO ME.

Welcome to my little cave!
